# Northwind Dataset SQL Queries Project

Welcome to my **Northwind Dataset SQL Queries** project! üìä This project involves querying data from the **Northwind** dataset using a variety of SQL techniques.

## üìö About the Project

In this project, I worked with the **Northwind** database, which contains data for a fictional company that imports and exports food and drink products. I performed several SQL queries using:

- **Joins** (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
- **WHERE** clause for filtering data
- **FROM** clause to define the data source
- **LIKE** for pattern matching
- **SELECT** to choose columns
- **ORDER BY** for sorting data
- **GROUP BY** for aggregating results

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how to extract meaningful information from relational databases using these fundamental SQL operations.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

- **SQL** for querying the database
- **Northwind Database** (provided by Microsoft for educational purposes)

## üîç Key SQL Queries

Here are some of the SQL queries I wrote during this project:


## Example 1: Retrieve all categories along with the number of products in each category.

## Example 2: Create a report for all the orders during 1996 and their Customers.

## Example 3: Retrieve the product name, category name, and supplier name for all products.

## Example 4: Retrieve all products belonging to the meat/poultry category

## Example 5: Retrieve the order ID, order date, customer name, and employee name for all orders.

## üóùÔ∏è Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with SQL queries for data extraction and analysis.
- Deepened understanding of **joins** to combine data from multiple tables.
- Used **GROUP BY** and **COUNT** to aggregate data effectively.
- Learned how to **filter** data using `WHERE` and `LIKE` for better query precision.

## üí° Conclusion

This project has been a great way to enhance my SQL skills, particularly in the context of working with real-world datasets. By using fundamental SQL operations such as **joins**, **grouping** and **filtering**, I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure and analyse data efficiently. I hope this project helps others who are learning SQL and I look forward to further improving my skills through similar projects!
